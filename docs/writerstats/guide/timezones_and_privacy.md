# WriterStats Guide - Timezones and Privacy

## Setting your timezone

To ensure that your days start and end at the correct time, WriterStats recommends you set your timezone. This is done with the `/settimezone` command, where you can pick your zone from the options provided. Start typing your country/city's name to let the autocompleter find your zone!

## Managing profile visibility

WriterStats allows other users in your servers to see your profile, which contains some information about your sessions. This is set to be public to other server members by default, but you can choose to make it private using the `/preferences toggle` command. To check your preferences, use `/preferences view`.
