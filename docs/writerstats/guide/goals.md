# WriterStats Guide - Goals

WriterStats has 2 types of wordcount goals that you can use: Project goals and user goals.

## Project goals

Project goals are wordcount goals for a project. This goal relates to the total wordcount of your project, and is set per-project using /project setgoal on your active project. The progress of this goal can be checked using `/project info`.

## User goals

User goals are based on the total number of words you've written across all projects. These can be set for daily, weekly, monthly and yearly periods to help you maintain your writing habits.

Any words that you add during a session will affect your user goals, with sessions with a negative net change not negatively impacting your goal. If you enter an edited value at the end of a session, that will be used instead of your net change.

### Creating a user goal

To set up a goal, use `/goals set` - you will need to run this command for each time period you wish to set a goal for.

### Viewing past goals

Your goal progress can be checked at any time with /goals view, and you can see how youâ€™ve done in previous goal periods with `/goals history`.
