# WriterStats Guide - Projects

WriterStats works using Projects and Sessions (see the next page), allowing you to work on several different works with the bot. You can create a new project at any time using `/project new`, and you need at least one of them to start using the bot.

## Setting your active project

You can have several projects set up in the bot and can switch between them using `/project setactive`. When you set up your first project, it is automatically set as your active project, but you'll have to manually switch to any further projects that you create.

## Project Info and Goals

If you want to know what project you're currently working on and view its progress, use `/project info` for its statistics. You can manually update the number of words in your project with /project setcount and add a wordcount goal to your project using `/project setgoal`.

## Renaming and deleting projects

If you wish to rename your current project, use `/project rename` to do so. To delete a project, you can use `/project delete`. This action is irreversible.
