# Welcome to the Guide!

We know starting with a new bot can be difficult, so this guide is designed to make the transition as smooth as possible. Navigate between the guide pages to learn about the different parts of WriterStats, allowing you to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to use it!

## Quickstart

If you want to get in to using the bot as quickly as possible, there's a shorter guide that you can follow. To access this, use WriterStats' `/quickstart` command in a channel! You can also use the `/help` command to find a full list of commands and how to use them, or use the discord command selector to explore them on your own!
