# WriterStats Guide - Statistics

There are a number of statistics that you can view for your writing:

## Server and Channel Statistics

- `/leaderboard` - this will give you the leaderboards for anyone in the server with WriterStats projects, based on the type you have selected. This updates once a day in each server.

- `/channel stats` - see the total words written in sessions in an individual channel/thread by all users.

## Personal Statistics

- `/week` and `/month` commands - see information about your own writing over a particular week/month, both as wordcount and time spent in sessions. Weeks with less than 14 sessions will also display individual session information.

- `/between` - see writing information between any two dates you specify. This is a patron only command.
