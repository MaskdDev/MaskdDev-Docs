# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how The Sprongler collects, uses, and protects your data.

## What data do we collect?

The Sprongler collects data relevant to your writing statistics, such as word count, time spent writing, project details, etc. This data is then passed on to authorised third parties ("integrations"), and The Sprongler does not claim any responsibility for the usage of this data by any such third parties. We also collect data to distinguish you from other users, such as your user ID, to store sprint-related data. The Sprongler does not collect or store any personal information, such as your name, email address, password, etc.

## How do we use your data?

The Sprongler provides your data to third parties you authorise ("integrations"), to allow it to plug into various statistics and writing management platforms. The Sprongler itself maintains little data on your writing, allowing it to run sprints and other related features without issue.

## How do we protect your data?

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your data is stored on a secure database, not accessible to the rest of our users. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data, as no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## How long do we keep your data?

We keep your data for as long as you use the service or until you delete your data. If you wish to delete your data, send us a deletion request to privacy@maskd.dev. This will remove all your data from our database and stop tracking your writing statistics.

## How do we share your data?

We do not sell, rent, or trade your data with any third parties, unless consent is given. We may share your data with:

-   Other users of the service, for the purpose of comparing and discussing your writing statistics
-   Service providers who help us operate and maintain the service
-   Law enforcement or regulatory authorities, if required by law or legal process

## How do we update this policy?

We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a notice on our discord server. Your continued use of the service after any changes to this policy constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.

## How do you contact us?

If you have any questions or feedback about The Sprongler or this policy, please contact us at support@maskd.dev.
